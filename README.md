# Bank statement Analysis -Data Cleaning

## Introduction
Welcome to the data cleaning documentation for a bank statement dataset from June 2021 to January 2022. I was provided with the bank statement To gain insights into the spending habits during the specified period. The dataset includes transactional data along with other relevant details.
This documentation aims to provide a clear and structured overview of the data cleaning process undertaken to prepare the dataset for analysis. 

## Dataset Description

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
The data cleaning and preparation process involved:
* Visual and programmatic assessments to identify any data quality issues
* Rectifying and cleaning the data to address the identified issues.

By following this process, I ensured the accuracy and reliability of the dataset for further analysis.

The cleaning and preparation prcocess was done using Python, and the Jupyter notebook containing the steps can be found [here](https://github.com/azeezat123/Bank-statement-Analysis/blob/main/Bank%20Statement%20Analysis%20-%20Data%20Cleaning.ipynb)
